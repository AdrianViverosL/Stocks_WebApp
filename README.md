# Stocks_WebApp
A Stocks portfolio using Django and Exchange's API

This project was crated using Django Framework as a demostration of a real application. For this case, I used an external API in order to fetch the 
actual stock information / data from a specific company, for example: Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc. 

This app has some features that allow us to create a portfolio with our favorites stocks and retrieve all their data in real time. 
For this matter, this app uses the data base included in the Django's Framework.
